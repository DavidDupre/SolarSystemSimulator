# SolarSystemSimulator

Another simulator of the solar system. 
This time, it's not n-body. Instead, it uses astrodynamics equations from Kepler and patched conics to propagate the orbits. 
It also simulates real satellites loaded from the public Celstrak database.
Basic space maneuvers exist, but more complex transfers are not yet implemented.

If anyone is wondering why I have a third iteration of the same project, my development cycle looks like this:
- Develop until its half-finished
- Add useless features
- Optimize early
- Bring a pot of cold water to a boil
- Break the spaghetti in half with your hands over the pot
- Stir occasionally, and allow the spaghetti to get soft
- Restart the project 

This time around I'm being extra careful to make sure each feature is solid before moving on.
