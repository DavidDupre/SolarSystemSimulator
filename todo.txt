Optimizations:
	- use KeplerCOE
	- buffer orbits for static orbits (but do it so it's pretty)
	- Canonical units
	
Features:
	- store TLEs using sat id
		- allows for duplicate names
	- GUI
		- Edit date
		- Control simulation speed
		- Navigate using tree-structure
		- Navigate using search
		- Turn orbits on or off
		- Create flight plans
	- Dynamic parents for ships
	- Library of maneuvers
	- Record delta-v expenditures. Sum for flight plans
	
Bugs:
	- Neptune escaped satellite
	- Shakes at large distances
