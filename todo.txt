Optimizations:
	- use KeplerCOE
	- buffer orbits for static orbits (but do it so it's pretty)
	- Canonical units
	
Features:
	- Two-line elements
		- load TLEs individually or by category using a GUI
	- GUI
		- Edit date (epoch)
		- Control simulation speed
		- Navigate using tree-structure
		- Navigate using search
		- Turn orbits on or off
		- Create flight plans
			- show projected orbit
		- Manage TLE database
	- Library of maneuvers
	- Record delta-v expenditures. Sum for flight plans
	
Bugs:
	- Neptune escaped satellite at high speeds
	- Shakes at large distances
	- Hohmann transfers into eccentric orbit
		- Because it starts eccentric?
		- Make sure flight path angle is zero!
	- Satellites escape at low fps (~2 fps)
