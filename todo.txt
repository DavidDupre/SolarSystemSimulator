Optimizations:
	- use KeplerCOE
	- Canonical units
	
Features:
	- GUI
		- Edit date (epoch)
		- Control simulation speed
		- Navigate using tree-structure
		- Navigate using search
		- Turn orbits on or off
		- Create flight plans
			- show projected orbit
		- Manage TLE database
	- Library of maneuvers
	- Record delta-v expenditures. Sum for flight plans
	- Parent-child heirarchy shouldn't depend on when you load the objects
	
Bugs:
	- Neptune escaped satellite at high speeds
	- Shakes at large distances
	- Satellites escape at low fps (~2 fps)
	- locking while updating could cause some epoch inaccuracies 
	- hyperbolas are ugly
		- fix by finding the true anomaly of escape
		- or time of escape
